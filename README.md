# GoogleMaps Review Scraper
This repo will help you to scrape the Google Maps review using Selenium. It is essential to download and place the webdriver.exe file on a certain location that will be called in the code. Follow the link below to download the same. 
        https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads (only if using Google Chrome as the web browser) For firefox and others follow similar other webpages to install the respective drivers

- The code in the repo uses all the selenium methods in the right manner post the last selenium upgrade. For example: If you are passing an XPATH while inspecting an element, use need to use (By.XPATH, "XPATH") rather than using the older version of the code which was find_element_xpath("XPATH") - this doesn't work now
